# Week 2: REST API with Static File front-end
1. We can take week 1 codes as starting point.
2. We will implement a REST API for the same functionality as week 1, but with a static file front-end.
3. Introduce GET POST PUT DELETE methods in REST API.

# Walkthrough:
1. Create new files `src/router.ts` and `src/types.ts`.
2. Move the `Task` interface and `TaskStatus` type to `src/types.ts`.
3. Move the `ApiResponse` type to `src/types.ts`.
