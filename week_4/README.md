# Wiring React front-end with Deno back-end
In this week we will not introduce that much of a new concept, but demonstrate how the React front-end is used with Deno back-end. Only new thing will be `useEffect` hook, and asynchronous fetching from the API. Back-end will focus on structuring the code and strenghtening the knowledge of API development. 
The application created during this demo will be a simple Joke Dashboard application, where we will fetch jokes from an external API and process them through our back-end, and then display them on the front-end. We will also add a feature to save jokes to the back-end, and display saved jokes on the front-end. 

Additionally, we'll add a form for the user to submit their own jokes, but this can be optional if the content is overwhelming.
